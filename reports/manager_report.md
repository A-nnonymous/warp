# Manager Report

Last updated: 2026-03-10

## Production View

- Stage: preflight bootstrap
- Delivery mode: control plane ready, implementation not started
- Current gate: G0 Protocol Freeze
- Current manager: A0
- Heartbeat policy: report real liveness only; do not assume workers are running

## Gates

- Passed: none
- Open: G0, G1, G2, G3, G4, G5, G6

## Real Liveness

- A0: healthy
- A1: not-started
- A2: not-started
- A3: not-started
- A4: not-started
- A5: not-started
- A6: not-started
- A7: not-started

## Runtime Topology

- Fork repository name: `target-repo`
- No worker runtime is registered yet
- No provider-specific worktree, branch, or environment is active

## Active Blockers

- FP8 protocol is not frozen
- baseline tensor contract is not frozen
- no worker agent has been launched yet
- no worktree or environment topology has been registered yet

## Next Runnable Set

- A0 may drive G0 documentation and freeze reviews now
- A1 is the first worker to launch when protocol drafting starts
- A6 launches with A1 to freeze tensor-level baseline mapping
- A2, A3, and A7 remain queued until A1 protocol draft exists

## Lock Summary

- High-conflict files are under single-writer lock control in `state/edit_locks.yaml`
- No lock contention is currently recorded

## Immediate Action

1. Launch or simulate A1 and A6 work through the control plane
2. Freeze protocol and baseline contract
3. Pass G0 before any implementation or experiment work
